#GLFW3 Tutorials
===============

Code for my tutorials on using GLFW3.

## Tutorial 1: Multi-Window Tutorial

Source code for [this tutorial](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html). This tutorial shows how to get mulitpuls windows going with GLFW3 and GLEW MX.

## Extra: Multi-Threaded Demo

This code is some attempts I made to add threading to the code from Tutorial 1. The idea was to have each window run on a seperate thread.
